After a disheartening loss of the viewer component code. I am determined to be a little bit more professional from now on.

The immediate plan is -

Load glTF model into the browser.

Make a clickable Threex domelement

Then I have to create some bounding boxes or other geometry based on the positions of the shelves etc.

Whether this is buffer geometry or regular geometry i'm not sure.

Then I need to connect with redux and form sliders.

Then i need to make sure everything is in sensible scale.

Then i need to apply materials and appearances.
